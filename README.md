### Title: 
/r/EarthPorn Visualizer

### Description:
This will pull off top images from reddit.com/r/EarthPorn and display them on a world map based on their location. Users can click on dots/pins to display the image in that location. 

### Vision Statement:
We want to make a map to visualize the most interesting locations on the planet

### Motivation:
Everyone likes looking at awesome pictures of nature, and this would simplify the process of seeing cool features around the world.

### Risks:
1. We would have to learn Reddit and perhaps Google APIs
2. This group has never worked together, so we have to figure out teamwork and team strengths.

### Risk Mitigation Strategy:
1. Dedicate time to learn how to interact with Reddit and Google APIs. Include a timeline in our meetings to make sure everyone is on track with learning.
2. Learn each other's strengths and weaknesses and focus heavily on communication and coordination.

### Methodology:
We plan on using an Agile methodology during the creation of this project

### Project Tracking Software:
We will be using Trello to track our progress
